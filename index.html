            <p>Powerlifting is a competitive strength sport that focuses on three primary exercises: the squat, bench
              press, and deadlift. Athletes in powerlifting aim to lift as much weight as possible in these three
              movements. It's a test of pure strength and determination, with competitors divided into various weight
              classes to ensure fairnessThe total weight lifted by a powerlifter is the sum of their best squat, bench
              press, and deadlift
              attempts. This total, often referred to as the "total kg.".</p>

            <p>Furthermore, there are different styles of
              powerlifting such as raw and multi-ply. Raw powerlifting involves lifting with minimal gear, typically
              just
              a singlet, belt, knee sleeves or wraps, and wrist wraps. This category emphasizes the lifter's natural
              strength and form, making it a purer test of raw power. In contrast, multi-ply powerlifting allows for the
              use of specialized supportive gear like squat suits, bench shirts, and deadlift suits, which provide
              additional assistance in lifting heavier weights.</p>

            <p>Powerlifting is a global sport undertaken by most countries. When looking at the Total Kg Average for
              each country we can see that Bolivia and Saudi Arabia ranked the highest however, this is only the average
              total kg, therefore, it does not imply that these are the strongest countries. According to this map
              Namibia is the weakest country.</p>

              884.51 kg. Furthermore, this graph shows that there a powerlifting competitors even at 90 years of age and

            <p>As we can see the sport of powerlifting is dominated by males as within each age bracket there is about
              double the amount of males than females. Furthermore, most participants fall into the 24 - 34 age range
              where there is a total of 4510 total males and 1842 females. This age range is when most humans are at
              their peak shape/performance therefore, there will likely be more participants.

            <p>Powerlifting has slowly become more a popular sport as time as gone on. This could be because gym is an
              entry point to powerlifting and overtime people have been more conscious about their fitness goals and
              thus, going to the gym. Powerlifting had a sharp decrease in 2019 and 2020 due to the covid19 lockdowns
              but had a huge resurgence in 2022 showing the highest number of participants at 2092.</p>

            <p>When it comes to powerlifting there will always be talks about the use of PED otherwise known as
              performance enhancing drugs such as steroids. Tested events attempt to ensure that all participants
              attending the event has not used any PEDs in the past year whereas, untested events it does not matter
              whether or not you've used PEDs. And as we can see there are more tested events than untested.</p>

              single layer of fabric on top of the belt and wraps. Multi-ply is the same as single-ply however, you can
              have two or more layers. And unlimited allows everything. Unlimited is a the least popular event.</p>

            <p>When comparing the average total kg based on body weight for females and males, males generally have a
              higher total kg than females. However, if we look at the body weights of 20kg the average female performs
              better than the average male. But when looking at the heavier body weights we can see that the males
              double the females average total kg.</p>

            <p>As we can see this grpah reiterates that males generally lift heavier than females however, it also shows
              which lifts are generally the strongest which is Deadlift then Squat then Bench. This could be due to the
              fact that in Deadlift and Squat the individual is using bigger muscles such as their legs to push the
              weight whereas, for bench it is there chest and triceps.</p>
