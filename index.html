            <p>Powerlifting is a <b>competitive strength sport</b> that focuses on three primary exercises: the
              <b>squat, bench
                press, and deadlift</b>. Athletes in powerlifting aim to lift as much weight as possible in these three
              movements. It's a test of pure strength and determination, with competitors divided into various weight
              classes to ensure fairness. <b>The total weight lifted by a powerlifter is the sum of their best squat,
                bench
                press, and deadlift</b>
              attempts. This total, often referred to as the "total kg".

        <div class="pure-u-1-2">
          <div class="paragraph2">
            <p>Furthermore, there are <b>different styles of
                powerlifting </b>such as raw and multi-ply. <b>Raw powerlifting</b> involves lifting with minimal gear,
              typically
              just
              a singlet, belt, knee sleeves or wraps, and wrist wraps. This category emphasizes the lifter's natural
              strength and form, making it a purer test of raw power. In contrast, <b>multi-ply</b> powerlifting allows
              for the
              use of specialized supportive gear like squat suits, bench shirts, and deadlift suits, which provide
              additional assistance in lifting heavier weights.</p>

              however, this is only the average total kg, therefore, it does not imply that these are the strongest
              countries. According to this map, <b>Namibia is the weakest country.</b></p>
